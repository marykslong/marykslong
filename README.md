- 👋 Hi, I’m @marykslong also known as @InternetGeopardy or @iGeopardy. I own The Deliberately Delightful Company.
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, AI, Data Science, and all things code. I'm also very interested in yoga and natural medicine. I am a Doctoral Candidate for Integrative Medicine. I teach yoga and dance outside of writing code. :)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning French and German, and getting back into code after a few years in graduate school for natural medicine. I speak Spanish.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on remote projects related to construction, transportation, logistics, and all things automation. I love data science.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm currently in NYC Metro Area on Eastern Time (EST). I prefer to be contacted via email or LinkedIn. Book a time for a phone call.
